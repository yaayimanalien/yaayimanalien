<!--- ## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ --->
Hi, I'm Reinis, a student from Latvia with passion for tech, software and music. Currently studying at LBTU, I wish to become a software engineer one day. I'm interested in developing music software, as that combines my two biggest interests. However, I'm always eager to learn more and collaborate on cool projects!
